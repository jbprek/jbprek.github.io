I recently came through a post about [Top 10 Books for Advanced-level Java Developers](http://java.dzone.com/articles/top-10-books-advanced-level). In this case although all of listed books are respectable, not all of them are about the the advanced Java developer. Books like "Enterprise Integration Patterns" can be quite irrelevant to the non EE developer and while OSGI is a very interesting development, I personally, as EE developer haven't met so far, a use case where OSGI could be applied (Have seen attempts to use it, when JCA would be appropriate). Also "The Java language specification" is a book for "Language Lawyers" and even a BAR exam like OCJP wont ask for so much Java language law expertise. Some familiarity with it's contents could be good, but trying to read it page by page would be a terrible waste of energy.

What I would add the list is the following:

1. The free Oracle java documentation, including the tutorials (which contains the best in my opinion cover of generics).

2. Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz and others, assuming basic thread knowledge.

3. Agile software development, by Robert Martin which covers 00 principles, design patterns etc. The excellent "Clean Code" book cited on the list, frequently refers to this one.

4. Java Puzzles by Joshua Block, not essential but entertaining, containing some surprising corner cases.
