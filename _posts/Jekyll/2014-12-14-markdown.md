The following are my basic references targetted to Github extended syntax:

1. Short guide including [Github extensions](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
1. A longer GitHub oriented [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
1. The original Markdown from [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
